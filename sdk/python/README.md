# Open Agentic Gateway Python SDK

This package provides gateway-only MCP/A2A clients and a backend JWT verifier that requires the configured token-exchange identity policy. The banking examples use it in both agents and both MCP servers.

The calling side uses `GatewayClient`; the receiving side uses `ExchangeTokenVerifier`. The gateway's protocol plugin verifies the caller token, the token-exchange plugin requests the route's configured backend access, and the trusted STS—not the gateway—authorizes and mints the limited target token. See the [complete request flow](../../README.md#how-an-agent-uses-the-gateway).

```sh
python -m pip install ./sdk/python
```

## Caller: use the gateway

```python
from open_agentic_gateway import Endpoint, GatewayClient, OAuthClientCredentials

provider = OAuthClientCredentials(
    token_endpoint="https://issuer.example.com/token",
    client_id="banking-orchestrator",
    client_secret=agent_secret,          # Loaded from your secret store.
)
gateway = GatewayClient(
    gateway_url="https://agents.example.com",
    token_provider=provider,
)
accounts = Endpoint(
    path="/mcp/accounts",
    audience="https://agents.example.com/mcp/accounts",
    scopes=("accounts:read",),
    protocol="mcp",
)
result = gateway.call_tool(accounts, "get_account_summary", {"account_id": "DEMO-001"})

review = Endpoint(
    path="/a2a/transaction-review",
    audience="https://agents.example.com/a2a/transaction-review",
    scopes=("a2a:review",),
    protocol="a2a",
)
response = gateway.send_message(review, "Summarize DEMO-TX-003")
```

The client obtains an agent token for each gateway audience, verifies HTTPS certificates, refuses redirects, and builds RPC URLs only relative to the configured gateway origin. It rejects absolute backend URLs in `Endpoint.path` and HTTP gateway origins. Supply `ca_file` to both objects for a private CA; otherwise they use system trust. There is no TLS-bypass option.

`OAuthClientCredentials` uses standard client credentials with an RFC 8707 `resource` parameter. Alternative grants can be supplied through a token provider implementing `get_token(audience, scopes)`; the SDK does not contain vendor-specific audience extensions.

The client has only agent credentials. It does not call the exchange grant or hold backend tokens. Configure the gateway's `token-exchange` plugin on each authenticated route; it is the broker that exchanges the caller token using its own STS credentials.

## Backend: mandate the exchange policy before dispatch

```python
from open_agentic_gateway import ExchangeTokenVerifier, AuthenticationError

verifier = ExchangeTokenVerifier(
    issuer="https://issuer.example.com/",
    audience="urn:bank:backend:accounts",
    scopes=("accounts:summary",),
    gateway_actor="banking-gateway",
    subjects=("banking-orchestrator",),  # Optional caller allowlist.
    jwks=public_signing_keys,           # Trusted public JWKS from your deployment.
)

# Your HTTP middleware runs this before executing an agent method or MCP tool.
try:
    claims = verifier.verify(request.headers.get("Authorization"))
except AuthenticationError:
    return unauthorized_response       # HTTP 401 + WWW-Authenticate: Bearer.

return dispatch_application_request(claims)
```

The verifier requires a signed JWT with the trusted issuer, backend audience, expiry, issued-at time, required backend scopes, and **`act.sub` equal to the configured gateway actor**. It rejects original gateway tokens, tokens for other backends, missing or incorrect actors, expired tokens, and invalid signatures. These checks use explicit exceptions and remain active with Python optimization enabled. There is no `require_exchange=False` switch. Required scopes are checked for presence; additional signed scopes are accepted. The trusted STS must issue only the permissions authorized for the target. This verifier does not impose a maximum scope set.

The STS must issue the signed actor claim under its configured exchange policy. [RFC 8693](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693#section-4.1) defines `act`; it does not require all exchanged tokens to include it. This SDK deliberately requires it for its exchange-only backend profile. An OAuth grant name is not cryptographic evidence encoded in a token. Enforcement trusts the issuer's signed audience/actor/scope claims and its issuance policy, not a caller-provided header or response receipt. Network access restrictions still belong to your deployment.

The banking fixture's `token_use` and `verified_upstream_identity` receipt are diagnostic data; neither is an SDK authorization mechanism. The SDK does not depend on Auth0 or any particular issuer.

## Current profile

Version `0.1.0` provides synchronous A2A 1.0 `SendMessage`/public card reads and MCP 2025-11-25 stateless initialization, metadata checks, tool discovery and calls, with JSON or POST SSE responses. It is a small gateway SDK, not a replacement for a complete protocol SDK. Resumable or stateful MCP sessions, A2A task lifecycle, async clients, and automatic token/key refresh are outside this initial profile. The backend verifier uses an explicitly supplied public signing JWKS with distinct `kid` values; reload trusted keys when your issuer rotates them. Opaque backend tokens need a different verifier and are not supported by this JWT guard.

See the [four banking components](../../examples/banking/README.md) for runnable Docker images and complete middleware integration.

A2A 1.0 synchronous SendMessage is available through JSON-RPC and HTTP+JSON/REST. Select `binding="HTTP+JSON"` on the SDK A2A `Endpoint` and use the advertised REST base path; the token audience stays the agent gateway audience. Token exchange and backend verification are identical for both bindings.

### MCP SSE responses and progress

`call_tool()` accepts JSON or `text/event-stream` responses and returns the final tool result. To receive progress while the response is streaming:

```python
result = gateway.call_tool(accounts, "get_account_summary",
    {"account_id": "DEMO-001", "stream": True},
    on_progress=lambda event: print(event["progress"], event.get("message"), flush=True))
```

The `stream` argument is specific to the banking example tools; other MCP servers choose their own response format. The SDK supplies `_meta.progressToken` when a callback is provided and delivers only progress notifications matching that token. It reads SSE events incrementally and checks the final JSON-RPC response ID. Callbacks run synchronously and their exceptions propagate. The 1 MiB cumulative response limit and socket timeout apply to streams; premature EOF, malformed events, and unexpected response IDs raise `GatewayError`. The stream is closed after the final response. GET streams, session persistence, resumption, and automatic retries are not implemented.
